# What is World Wide Web?
It is also known as Web</br>
It is a collection of websites or web pages stored in web servers and are connected to local computers through internet.</br>

To understand Web :
Webpages: These are the documents on the web that can contain text, images, videos, and othe multimedia. They are written in HTML</br>

Web browswers: Software applications like chrome, edge etc are required to access and view web pages.</br>

URLs: The addresses used to access web pages.</br>

HTTP/HTTPS: These are protocols uses for transferring web pages over the internet.

Analogy:</br>
Web pages are the books.</br>
Web browsers are the librarians who help you find and read the books.</br>
URLs are like catalog numbers that tell the librarian which book to want.</br>
HTTP/HTTPS: These are the methods that librarian uses to retrieve the book and hand over to you securely.

# Explain  <!DOCTYPE html> 
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration is a critical component of HTML documents. It stands for "Document Type Declaration" and tells the web browser which version of HTML the document is written in. This declaration helps the browser render the content correctly. </br>
For HTML5, the declaration is simply <!DOCTYPE html>

# What are HTML elements and why we use it?
An HTML is a building block of a webpage which represents the different part of contents such as text,images, links etc.</br>
We use it to define the structure and content of web pages, enabling broswers to interpret and display them correctly to users.

# What are HTML attributes?
HTML attributes provides additional information about the HTML elements/tags. </br>
HTML attributes consist of two parts: attribute name and its value

# Form tag Syntax

The default method is GET;

GET: When this method is used, form data will be appended to the URL and visible to everyone. Example: /travelDestinySuccess.html?username=Alex.

# Table Tag
Syntax:
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th></th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

The border attribute is used to provide the border to the table.
The <thead> tag is used to provide the heading to the table.
The <tr> tag is used to create the rows in the table.
The <th> tag is used to create the columns in the table.
The <tbody> tag is used to enclose the content in table.
The <td> tag is used to provide content or data to the table.

# Anchor Tag
Any text or image that provides a link to another webpage is called as "hyperlink".

A website consists of multiple webpages. Generally webpages need to be linked with one another to make it navigable. To link webpages, anchor element is used.

Syntax:
<a href="url" target="value">Text</a>

The href attribute is used to specify the URL of the webpage that needs to be linked.
The target attribute is used to specify where to open the linked webpage.

# Image Element

alt attribute:
The alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image. This is helpful when the user is unable to view the image because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.

The value of the alt attribute should describe the image. Therefore it is a good coding practice to use alt attribute.

----------------------------CSS--------------------------
# CSS syntax?
selectors { 
  css-property: value; 
} 

# Pseudo-class
A CSS pseudo-class can be described as a keyword that is added to a selector which defines a special state of the selected elements. Using the same we can provide the styling to be applied when the HTML element changes its state. 

For example, it can be used to: 

style an element when it gets focus, i.e. the state is "focus" 
style an element when a user hovers over it, i.e. the state is "hover" 
style visited and un-visited links differently 
Syntax:

selector: pseudo-class { 
          css-property: value; 
         } 
		 
We can style our links based on their state using the following pseudo-classes.

Pseudo-class	Description
:link			It is used to style links which are not visited.
:visited		Styles the state of the link when link is visited atleast once.
:hover			Styles the state of the link when mouse is placed over the link.
:active			Styles the state of the link, when you can click on the link.

With the following pseudo-classes, we can also style the input fields based on their state.

Pseudo-class	Description
:focus			Styles the state of element that is currently targeted or activated by mouse.
:enabled		Styles the state of element that is enabled and associated with input field.
:required		Styles the input element with required attribute.
:checked		Styles the state of element when it is selected.

# Pseudo Elements:
A CSS pseudo-element can be taken as a keyword that is added to a selector which lets you to design a specific part of the selected elements. 

For example, it can be placeholder of input field or first line of the paragraph. Also, we can add content before and after the text using pseudo elements. 

They are usually denoted by two colons (::) together, unlike single colon (:) for pseudo classes. 

Syntax:
selector::pseudo-element{ 
            property: value; 
           } 

The different types of pseudo-elements are as shown in the table below:

Pseudo-element	Description
::first-line	Used to style first line of the text.
::first-letter	Styles the first letter of text. Applied only to block level elements.
::before		Used to insert content or style before the content of element.
::after			Used to insert content or style after the content of element.
::selection		Used to style the portion of element that is selected by the user.

# What is Box Model? 
The CSS box model is basically an invisible box which wraps around every HTML element. Thus, HTML elements are considered as boxes, be it a <div> tag or a <p> tag or any other tag. In CSS, the term "Box Model" is used when we are talking about design and layout. 

CSS Box Model consists of following:  

margins 
borders 
padding
actual content

Content - The innermost box in the CSS box model represents the content. This is the actual data/text/image that should be displayed. 
Padding - The immediate box enclosing the content is called the padding. This is used to provide some space between any border applied and the actual data/text. The padding is transparent, and the dimensions can be modified to be closer to or farther away from the border. 
Border - The border is a visible box enclosing the content and the padding. The border dimensions can be modified, and the border itself can be styled to be a colored dotted line/continuous line or more. 
Margin - This margin is a transparent box outside the border. This is heavily used when we must display a lot of content and avoid content overlapping.


# Introduction to Flexbox:-
Flexbox is one of the most widely used CSS properties that help us to align elements in the given available space of the HTML document.  

It is a one-dimensional layout structure that has good and strong capabilities of aligning items dynamically within a given container by maintaining proper spaces between each item under that container. Since it supports dynamic change in appearance, it is named ‘flex’.
