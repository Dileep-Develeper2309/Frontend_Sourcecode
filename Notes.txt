# What is World Wide Web?
It is also known as Web</br>
It is a collection of websites or web pages stored in web servers and are connected to local computers through internet.</br>

To understand Web :
Webpages: These are the documents on the web that can contain text, images, videos, and othe multimedia. They are written in HTML</br>

Web browswers: Software applications like chrome, edge etc are required to access and view web pages.</br>

URLs: The addresses used to access web pages.</br>

HTTP/HTTPS: These are protocols uses for transferring web pages over the internet.

Analogy:</br>
Web pages are the books.</br>
Web browsers are the librarians who help you find and read the books.</br>
URLs are like catalog numbers that tell the librarian which book to want.</br>
HTTP/HTTPS: These are the methods that librarian uses to retrieve the book and hand over to you securely.

# Explain  <!DOCTYPE html> 
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration is a critical component of HTML documents. It stands for "Document Type Declaration" and tells the web browser which version of HTML the document is written in. This declaration helps the browser render the content correctly. </br>
For HTML5, the declaration is simply <!DOCTYPE html>

# What are HTML elements and why we use it?
An HTML is a building block of a webpage which represents the different part of contents such as text,images, links etc.</br>
We use it to define the structure and content of web pages, enabling broswers to interpret and display them correctly to users.

# What are HTML attributes?
HTML attributes provides additional information about the HTML elements/tags. </br>
HTML attributes consist of two parts: attribute name and its value

# Form tag Syntax
<form name="Name of the form" action="Link to server-side program" method="HTTP Request method" target="Where to display the response">
</form>
name ->	Unique name that identifies a form.
action ->	URL of the destination page
method ->	Commonly used HTTP methods are : GET and POST

The default method is GET;

GET: When this method is used, form data will be appended to the URL and visible to everyone. Example: /travelDestinySuccess.html?username=Alex.

POST: When this method is used, form data is placed inside HTTP request body and not visible;

novalidate ->	Skips validations upon form submission.
target ->	opens response in a new window/tab, same frame

# Input element in Forms
The <input> tag specifies an input field used inside a form, where the user can enter data.
Syntax:
<input type="input-type" value="element-value"/>

Input types in HTML5 
Value		Description
text	->	Creates a string input field.
password->	Creates a password input field in masked format
radio	->	Creates a radio button.

range	->	Input that lets the user choose a number from a range.

Attributes of the input element 
The table below lists the attributes of the <input> tag:

Attributes		Description
required	->	Value required for form submission.
value		->	Specifies default value of input element.
type		->	Identifies type of input element.
name 		->	Name of input element used for form submission.
size		->	Identifies the width of input text that the user can see.
autofocus	->	Focuses on a particular form element automatically.
maxlength	->	Identifies the maximum length of input value.
minlength	->	Identifies the minimum length of input value.
pattern	Specifies a pattern (regular expression) for entering input text. 
placeholder	->	Displays a text (hint) within an input control for the user.
steps		->	Specifies the legal number of intervals.
formnovalidate	Skips validations upon form submission, used with submit button. 
readonly	->	Prevents user from modifying the value, value will passed on submit
disabled	->	Prevents from modifying the value, value is not sent on submit
multiple	-> 	allows to enter/select more than one value

# Table Tag
Syntax:
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th></th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

The border attribute is used to provide the border to the table.
The <thead> tag is used to provide the heading to the table.
The <tr> tag is used to create the rows in the table.
The <th> tag is used to create the columns in the table.
The <tbody> tag is used to enclose the content in table.
The <td> tag is used to provide content or data to the table.

# Anchor Tag
Any text or image that provides a link to another webpage is called as "hyperlink".

A website consists of multiple webpages. Generally webpages need to be linked with one another to make it navigable. To link webpages, anchor element is used.

Syntax:
<a href="url" target="value">Text</a>

The href attribute is used to specify the URL of the webpage that needs to be linked.
The target attribute is used to specify where to open the linked webpage.

# Image Element
Images can be inserted into HTML page by using <img/> tag.

The <img/> tag is an empty tag as it does not have a closing tag.

Attributes of image element
Attributes		Description
src				Specifies the path of the image
border			Specifies the border of the image
width 			Specifies the width of the image in pixels
height			Specifies the height of the image in pixels
alt				Provides an alternative text describing the image, if image is not available

Attributes of Image element
src attribute:
The src attribute specifies the URL from where the image resource is loaded.

alt attribute:
The alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image. This is helpful when the user is unable to view the image because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.

The value of the alt attribute should describe the image. Therefore it is a good coding practice to use alt attribute.

# Audio element

----------------------------CSS--------------------------
# CSS syntax?
selectors { 
  css-property: value; 
} 

# Pseudo-class
A CSS pseudo-class can be described as a keyword that is added to a selector which defines a special state of the selected elements. Using the same we can provide the styling to be applied when the HTML element changes its state. 

For example, it can be used to: 

style an element when it gets focus, i.e. the state is "focus" 
style an element when a user hovers over it, i.e. the state is "hover" 
style visited and un-visited links differently 
Syntax:

selector: pseudo-class { 
          css-property: value; 
         } 
		 
We can style our links based on their state using the following pseudo-classes.

Pseudo-class	Description
:link			It is used to style links which are not visited.
:visited		Styles the state of the link when link is visited atleast once.
:hover			Styles the state of the link when mouse is placed over the link.
:active			Styles the state of the link, when you can click on the link.

With the following pseudo-classes, we can also style the input fields based on their state.

Pseudo-class	Description
:focus			Styles the state of element that is currently targeted or activated by mouse.
:enabled		Styles the state of element that is enabled and associated with input field.
:required		Styles the input element with required attribute.
:checked		Styles the state of element when it is selected.

# Pseudo Elements:
A CSS pseudo-element can be taken as a keyword that is added to a selector which lets you to design a specific part of the selected elements. 

For example, it can be placeholder of input field or first line of the paragraph. Also, we can add content before and after the text using pseudo elements. 

They are usually denoted by two colons (::) together, unlike single colon (:) for pseudo classes. 

Syntax:
selector::pseudo-element{ 
            property: value; 
           } 

The different types of pseudo-elements are as shown in the table below:

Pseudo-element	Description
::first-line	Used to style first line of the text.
::first-letter	Styles the first letter of text. Applied only to block level elements.
::before		Used to insert content or style before the content of element.
::after			Used to insert content or style after the content of element.
::selection		Used to style the portion of element that is selected by the user.

# What is Box Model? 
The CSS box model is basically an invisible box which wraps around every HTML element. Thus, HTML elements are considered as boxes, be it a <div> tag or a <p> tag or any other tag. In CSS, the term "Box Model" is used when we are talking about design and layout. 

CSS Box Model consists of following:  

margins 
borders 
padding
actual content

Content - The innermost box in the CSS box model represents the content. This is the actual data/text/image that should be displayed. 
Padding - The immediate box enclosing the content is called the padding. This is used to provide some space between any border applied and the actual data/text. The padding is transparent, and the dimensions can be modified to be closer to or farther away from the border. 
Border - The border is a visible box enclosing the content and the padding. The border dimensions can be modified, and the border itself can be styled to be a colored dotted line/continuous line or more. 
Margin - This margin is a transparent box outside the border. This is heavily used when we must display a lot of content and avoid content overlapping.


# Introduction to Flexbox:-
Flexbox is one of the most widely used CSS properties that help us to align elements in the given available space of the HTML document.  

It is a one-dimensional layout structure that has good and strong capabilities of aligning items dynamically within a given container by maintaining proper spaces between each item under that container. Since it supports dynamic change in appearance, it is named ‘flex’.  

Flex Container and its Properties:-
Flex Container : A flexbox requires a container within which all elements can be aligned. Hence, a flex container will have the ability to alter all the elements that comes within that container but not any other element. 

Properties of a flex container:

display 
flex-direction 
flex-wrap

# CSS Grid
CSS Grid is the latest way to create layouts.  

CSS grid is an effective tool for designing intricate web page layouts is CSS Grid. You can make rows and columns, specify their sizes and locations, and then insert content inside of them using CSS Grid. Here is a step-by-step tutorial on using CSS Grid to create a straightforward layout.

Property	Description
display: grid	
This is what creates a grid system. Typically this is applied to a container 

element within which all the content is placed.

grid-column-template: 1fr 1fr	
This allows to create a template for columns in all rows. This code example 

would create two columns which occupy one fraction each of the available space

grid-column:  3/5	
This allows to span a column across grid lines. This code example would span the 

column from line 3 to 5

grid-gap:  5px	
This allows to apply a gap between all rows and columns. This code example would 

create a gap of 5px

# Transformation
A transformation is an effect that lets an element to change its shape, size, and position.
The following are the few CSS transform functions:

1. Translate

2. Scale

3. Rotate

Translate
Translate function is used to move an element in the horizontal, vertical direction and sideways.

Syntax:
transform : translate( x, y )

Scale
Scale function is used to resize an element.

Using the scale function we can shrink and expand an element.

Syntax:

transform : scale(x) -> scales the height and width by x-value
transform: scale(x,y) -> scales the element width(x-value) and height(y value)

# Transition
CSS transitions allow us to change the values of any property, over a given duration in a smooth manner rather than having them occur immediately.

Using CSS transition, effects can be added to elements without the need for any scripting language or additional software like Flash.

To create a transition effect, following must be specified:

The CSS property to which the effect should be added.
The duration of the effect.

# What are CSS animations?

CSS3 Animations can be used to replace animated images, scripts, and flash animations in most of the web pages.

Animations in CSS are done using key-frames.

The @keyframes style rule controls the intermediate steps in a CSS animation sequence.

Step 1: Defining the animation using @keyframes and specify multiple changes in style

@keyframes exampleAnimation {
    from { background-color: red; }
    to { background-color: yellow; }
}

As an alternative to step 1, we can break the whole animation down into incremental values to make up a total of 100% as shown below.

@keyframes exampleAnimation2 {
    0% { background-color: red; }
    25% { background-color: yellow; }
    50%  { background-color: blue; }
    100% { background-color: green; }
}

Let's take the example of making an animation that slides a square from left to right. Using @keyframes, we can define the animation as follows:

@keyframes move {
    0%   { left: 0; }
    100% { left: 100%; }
}

Step 2: Binding the animation to a selector. Here we will be binding the exampleAnimation to a div selector

div {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: red;
    animation: exampleAnimation 4s;
}

As an alternative to step 2, we can specify each property separately as shown below:

div {
    animation-name: exampleAnimation;
    animation-duration: 4s;
    animation-timing-function: linear;
    animation-delay: 2s;
    animation-iteration-count: infinite;
    animation-direction: alternate;
}

# What is Responsive Web Design?
Responsive Web Design(RWD) is an approach of designing your web application to make it render well on devices with different sizes.

By RWD, the screen elements and contents automatically change its sizes and reshuffles their positions according to the available screen size which enhances the user experience for that application.

The Viewport:-
The user’s visible area of web page is known as viewport. It varies and is different for different sizes of screens. 

Setting the viewport: 

You should include the below meta tag in all web applications which needs to be responsive: 

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> 

Media Queries:-
Media queries are used to specify how the web page should look on different sizes of screens.

Syntax:

@media not|only mediatype and (expressions){ 
        css-code 
  } 
  
It consists of following elements: 

media type: It is the screen on which the corresponding page is getting rendered. It can take the below given values according to the device we want to display our page in. 

Value	Description
All	All media type devices
Print	Printer-friendly layouts
Screen	All devices with a display screens
Speech	Screen Reader friendly pages
 

expressions: The expressions are used to specify a wide variety of specifications, like min-height or max-width or max-resolution or even whether the user should be able to hover over elements or not.

The expressions are expected to be resolved to true or false. 

If the specified expressions resolve to true, and the media type specified also matches the media type on which the page is displayed, then the media query result is true.

If the media query result is true, only then will the specified CSS style be applied on the page.

Operators: not or only are optional operators. Not keyword is used to negate the whole media query while only keywords prevents the old browsers that do not support media queries from applying the given style.

Here is an illustration of the @media rule in action:

body {
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 1.5;
  color: #333;
}

/* Styles for devices with a maximum width of 768 pixels */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  body {
    font-size: 14px;
  }
}

/* Styles for devices with a maximum width of 480 pixels */
@media (max-width: 480px) {
  body {
    font-size: 12px;
    line-height: 1.2;
  }
}

# Variables in CSS :-
You can declare a value only once and reuse it across your stylesheet by using CSS variables, also referred to as CSS custom properties. This can make it simpler to maintain and update your CSS code because you only need to modify the variable's value once to have an impact across all of its usage.

1. Declaring a variable 

 While declaring a variable, the custom property name must start with -- (2 hyphens) followed by the property name. 

 A variable can be declared as shown below

--text-color: brown; 

2. Using the declared variable 

The variable which is declared can be used with a function called var. This function is helpful in inserting the value of a custom property instead of a pre-  defined value. 

The variable can be assigned to any css property that accepts the declared value. 

For example, if the variable declared is  

  --text-color: brown; 

Note: CSS variables are case sensitive
